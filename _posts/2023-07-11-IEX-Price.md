title: IEX Price Endpoint

When using the [Price Only](https://www.iexcloud.io/docs/api/#price-only) endpoint, it returns a value which is the latestPrice attribute in the Quote endpoint. The latestPrice refers to the latest relevant price of the security which is derived from multiple sources. We first look for an IEX real-time price. If an IEX real-time price is older than 15 minutes, 15 minute delayed market price is used. If a 15-minute delayed price is not available, we will use the current-day close price. If a current-day close price is not available, we will use the last available closing price. IEX real-time price represents trades on IEX only. Trades occur across over a dozen exchanges, so the last IEX price can be used to indicate the overall market price. 15-minute delayed prices are from all markets using the [Consolidated Tape](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/national-market-system-plan.asp). This will not include pre or post-market prices.

The close price will be a 15-minute delayed price. Unless the Nasdaq [UTP](https://www.utpplan.com) (Unlisted Trading Priviledges) Authorisation is in place, the Nasdaq close prices will be available at 8pm ET.
