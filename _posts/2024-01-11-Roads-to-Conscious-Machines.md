The Road to Conscious Machines: The Story of AI
Michael Wooldridge

> A classic introduction to the ideas of strong AI and conscious machines is Maggie Boden's _Artificial Intelligence and Natural Man_ (MIT Press, 1977). For a detailed textbook introduction to consciousness, there is Susan Blackmore's _Consciousness: An Introduction_ (Hodder & Stoughton, 2010). Almost anything Daniel Dennett has written on the subject of mind, consciousness and AI is worth reading - as a starting point, I recommend _Kinds of Minds_ (Basic Books, 1996). And if you only read one thing as a follow-up to this book, I recommend his essay _Where Am I?_, which originally appeared in his 1978 book _Brainstorms_; it is readily available online.
