The firm will need to establish what activity group they fall under as per [FEES 4 Annex 1A](https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/FEES/4/Annex1A.html). Once you have identified the activity group(s) you fall in you will need to determine the pricing category you fall under, as per [FEES 3 Annex 1](https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/FEES/3/Annex1.html) and then to check the cost of this, check [FEES 3 Annex 1A](https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/FEES/3/Annex1A.html).
