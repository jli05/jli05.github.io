# AAAI Symposium on KRR
AAAI Spring Symposium on Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, March 23-25, 2015

1. Hinton talked about Fast Associative Memory vs Neural Turing Machine. I found following references regarding Associative Memory:
   - Knoblauch A, Neural Associative Memories and Sparse Coding, 2013
   - Knoblauch A, Neural Associative Memory with Optimal Bayesian Learning, 2011
   - Austin J, Distributed Associative Memories for High Speed Symbolic Reasoning, 1996
   - Wang H, et al, Recurrent Neural Networks: Associative Memory and Optimization, 2011
2. Gary Marcus argues for a canonical circuit in the cerebral cortex, adaptive for different functions.
