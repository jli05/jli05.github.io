### Valuation Calculation
Founder: $3M pre-money → $4M post-money, ownership at 75%.
VC: Adjusts for 20% pre-funding option pool, "true" pre-money is $2.4M, ownership at 60%.

### Option Pool
Founder: Assumes minimal dilution, unaware of VC's pre-funding requirement.
VC: Requires a 15–20% option pool pre-funding, lowering founder equity.

### Liquidation Preferences
Founder: Expects investors to get their money back first in a sale.
VC: Adds 2x–3x participating preferred, reducing founder payout on smaller exits.

### Preferred Stock Terms
Founder: May misunderstand or overlook participating preferred terms.
VC: Uses these terms to protect downside and boost returns on smaller exits.

### Negotiation Strategy
Founder: Accepts terms quickly due to urgency or lack of knowledge.
VC: Structures terms to maximize returns while appearing founder-friendly.

### Pre-Money vs Post-Money
Founder: Sees valuation as pre-money + capital raised.
VC: Adjusts pre-money valuation after factoring in option pool.

### Valuation Anchoring
Founder: Focuses on high headline valuation to minimize dilution.
VC: Frames discussions around ownership percentages and post-money equity.

### Revenue Multiples
Founder: Uses optimistic projections or market comparables.
VC: Applies conservative revenue multiples based on sector benchmarks.

### Future Dilution Considerations
Founder: Overlooks dilution from future funding rounds.
VC: Models dilution across rounds to maintain target ownership.

### Cap Table Implications
Founder: Doesn’t assess long-term cap table dynamics beyond the current round.
VC: Models impact on employee options, pro rata rights, and founder equity.
Learn the math. Master the terms. Protect your stake.
