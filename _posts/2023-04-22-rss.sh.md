title: rss.sh, A RSS Reader 
layout: post
---

## Introduction
[https://github.com/jli05/rss.sh](https://github.com/jli05/rss.sh) is a simple RSS reader that works with RSS 2.0 and Atom feed format.

The user specifies the RSS feed URLs inside `rss.sh`. `rss.sh` is the driver which employs `rss.py` to read and parse the RSS feeds. Inside `rss.py` it calls the `curl` command to retrieve the URLs.

When all RSS entries are parsed and printed, the output is sent to AWS S3 and emails via AWS SNS if an S3 bucket and/or the SNS Topic ARN are specified inside `rss.sh`.

## How it is run
Rather than running as a Docker for AWS Lambda, we put the code on an EC2 instance. Every morning the EC2 instance is started by an AWS Lambda function (upon being evoked by an AWS EventBridge event) and a cron job is run on the instance. The crontab spec on the EC2 instance:

```
0-30 06 * * * flock -n /tmp/rss -c /home/ec2-user/rss.sh/cron.sh
```

The AWS EventBridge event is set to delivered at 06:00 UTC+0 -- usually it gets delivered on time, but for <1% of time it may take >10 mins delay to get delivered. Hence during the 30-minute period we try to run `cron.sh`. `flock` locks a file prior to running a command to ensure that at any time only one session of `cron.sh` is running.

The `cron.sh` simply runs `rss.sh`, and shuts down the EC2 instance when done.

```sh
#!/bin/sh

PROJDIR=$(dirname $0)
$PROJDIR/rss.sh -2d
sudo shutdown +0
```

One may conveniently log all output and errors from within `cron.sh`,

```sh
#!/bin/sh

PROJDIR=$(dirname $0)
$PROJDIR/rss.sh -2d 1>XXX.out 2>XXX.err
sudo shutdown +0
```

## The DevOp
### IAM Policies
In the cloud, we need to launch an EC2 instance, which needs to be able to sync to S3 and publish to SNS;

We also need to set up an AWS Lambda function, which upon receiving an EventBridge event, is able to start the EC2 instance and write to the AWS CloudWatch Logs.

So the EC2 instance will assume [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) Role "rss-ec2-instance", which incorporates three IAM Policies "s3-rss-read", "s3-rss-write" and "sns-publish-rss";

the Lambda function will assume IAM Role "start-rss-ec2-instance", which incorporates IAM Policies "start-rss-ec2-instance" and "logs-write".

Below are the JSON definitions of the abovementioned IAM Policies.

s3-rss-read:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor2",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

s3-rss-write:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

sns-publish-rss:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowPublishToRSS",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sns:Publish",
            "Resource": "<topic_arn>"
        }
    ]
}
```

start-rss-ec2-instance:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:StartInstances"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {
                    "aws:ResourceTag/Name": "<name of the EC2 instance>"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

logs-write:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### The Lambda function
The Lambda function "start-rss", bearing IAM Role "start-rss-ec2-instance", is defined as:

```python
import boto3
region = 'eu-west-1'
instances = ['i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx']
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=region)

import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=instances)
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('started your instances: '
                           + str(instances))
    }
```

It is triggered by EventBridge event delivered every 06:00 UTC+0 according to cron expression "cron(0 06 \* \* ? \*)".
