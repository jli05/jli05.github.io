#### Cost Estimate
Option 1: $875/month for unlimited usage 

or

Option 2: Billing would depend upon usage. Usage would depend upon the symbols being queried and the schema used. If you are only looking for OHLCV-1minute aggregate bars for all traded symbols, the costs would only be around $40/month. 

#### When are the settlement prices ready?
We offer data via either our live client (real-time), or our historical client (T+1). Data is published to the historical client around 9 AM ET each day for the day prior.

#### Redistribution Right
We allow for full redistribution, including display use case redistribution. The only thing that we ask is for attribution, "data provided by Databento" or similar.
